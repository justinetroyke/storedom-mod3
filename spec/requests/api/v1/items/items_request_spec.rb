# *1. Create an API*
#
# We need an API for the application that can both read and write data. Start by focusing on functionality for items. All of this should happen in a dedicated, versioned controller.
#
#
# When I send a GET request to `/api/v1/items/1`
# I receive a 200 JSON response containing the id, name, description, and image_url but not the created_at or updated_at
#
# When I send a DELETE request to `/api/v1/items/1`
# I receive a 204 JSON response if the record is successfully deleted
#
# When I send a POST request to `/api/v1/items` with a name, description, and image_url
# I receive a 201 JSON  response if the record is successfully created
# And I receive a JSON response containing the id, name, description, and image_url but not the created_at or updated_at
#
# * Verify that your non-GET requests work using Postman or curl. (Hint: `ActionController::API`). Why doesnâ€™t the default `ApplicationController` support POST and PUT requests?
